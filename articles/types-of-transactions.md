# Types of Transactions

Crypto networks support several types of transactions.

## 1. Normal Transfers
Sending crypto from one wallet to another.

## 2. Smart Contract Transactions
Interacting with apps (like DeFi, staking, DEX trading).

## 3. Token Transfers
Transferring tokens on a blockchain (ERC-20, SPL, BEP-20).

## 4. Swap Transactions

Each type requires gas fees depending on network traffic.
