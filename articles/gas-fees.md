# Gas Fees on Blockchains

Gas fees are small payments required to process blockchain transactions.

## Why Gas Fees Exist
- To reward validators/miners  
- To prevent network spam  
- To prioritize transactions  

## Gas Fees Example
- Ethereum: $1 – $20 (depends on load)  
- Solana: near zero  
- BNB Chain: very low  

## How to Reduce Gas Fees
- Use networks like Solana or BNB  
- Make transactions during low traffic times  

Gas fees keep blockchains secure and functional.
