# Types of Wallets

Crypto wallets store your keys, not your coins.

## 🟩 1. Hot Wallets (Online)
Examples:
- MetaMask  
- Trust Wallet  
- Phantom  

Pros: Easy to use  
Cons: More hackable  

## 🟥 2. Cold Wallets (Offline)
Examples:
- Ledger  
- Trezor  

Pros: Safest  
Cons: Expensive  

## 🟦 3. Exchange Wallets
Coins stored on exchanges (Binance, Coinbase).

Pros: Simple  
Cons: Exchange controls your keys  

Always keep large amounts in a hardware wallet.
